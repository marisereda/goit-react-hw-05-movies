# Movies

The **Movies** project is a basic routing for a movie search and storage
application. Themoviedb.org API is used for the backend. The collection of the
most popular movies for today is created on the Home page. On the Movies page, there is a search by movie name. Clicking the movie card one can see the movie
details, including cast and reviews.

The project demonstrates the use of React Router Dom library, making routes,
and rendering components depending on the current route.

## There were used:

- React
